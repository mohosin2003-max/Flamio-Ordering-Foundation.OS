- Opening hours and scheduled-order slots live in `src/lib/opening-hours.ts` (pure, Asia/Dhaka) with the server read in `opening-hours.server.ts`; placeOrder and game play re-check them server-side — one source of truth for browser preview and server enforcement.
- Scheduled pre-orders are ordinary `orders` rows with status `scheduled`; `activate_due_scheduled_orders()` (run by the minute dispatcher) flips them to `placed`, which reuses the existing alert/Kitchen/alarm path — no parallel order system.
