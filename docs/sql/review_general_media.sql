-- Flamio customer reviews — FINAL.
--
-- Signed-in customers only (no guest/anonymous reviews).
-- Written review + star rating + OPTIONAL PHOTO. No video anywhere:
-- no video column, no video storage, no video policy.
--
-- Run this in the external Supabase project's SQL Editor. Existing
-- order-linked reviews, their photos and their moderation status are preserved.
--
-- NOTE: supabase/migrations/20260921174000_review_general_media.sql is an old
-- draft (guest + video support) and must NOT be used. This file is the only
-- SQL to apply.

-- 1. General (order-less) reviews need order_id to be optional.
ALTER TABLE public.order_reviews
  ALTER COLUMN order_id DROP NOT NULL;

-- 2. Remove anything an earlier draft may have added.
ALTER TABLE public.order_reviews
